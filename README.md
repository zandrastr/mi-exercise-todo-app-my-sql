# Todo app with MySql ✔️🚀

A school exercise building a simple to-do application to practice MySQL.   
This was my first project using MySQL, and I learned about how to connect to the database, create routes, and implement CRUD operations. I also gained a better understanding of how the database, backend server, and frontend interact with each other. The styling is kept simple as the focus in this exercise was MySQL.

To create the app, I used the following technologies: 
- MySQL
- phpMyAdmin
- Express
- Node.js
- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS
